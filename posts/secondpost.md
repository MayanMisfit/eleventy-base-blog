<p>I don't know why I wrote this, it just happened ok</p>

I am he who bends\
his will to ensure\
your dreams are sweet\
and true

So come my love\
come dream with\
me and we shall\
dance in the\
heavens amongst\
the stars so bright\
this glorious night

We shall dance sun\
we shall dance\
the moon

So come my beloved\
come, come, come\
dream with me\
and we shall dance\
the dance of\
lovers this glorious\
night.
